# Port Control Application
This is an application to control the movimentation of container in the port.
It's possible to register container and clients, 
register the movimentations of the containers that are group by the initial date of the movimentation.
There is a report tab based on customer order movements.
I used autocomplete to search the containers in the database and jQuery to make validation on the search form.
